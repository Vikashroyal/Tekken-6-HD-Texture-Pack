# Installation
Create a folder, name it `ULUS10466` in `memstick\PSP\TEXTURES` and copy all the contents from the downloaded .zip file into it.  
**Note:**
- Turn any texture scaling options **OFF**.
- Do **NOT** enable texture saving.
- As much as possible, use Vulkan as the backend to decrease potential stuttering.
