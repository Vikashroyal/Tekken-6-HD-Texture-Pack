# Tekken 6 HD

This texture pack is a one-man project that began on 2016, now ready for release.

# What's new?
### `v0.1`
- All stages now feature higher-quality textures. 
- Mob sprites are collected into respective folders.

# How to Install
Create a folder named `ULUS10466` in `memstick\PSP\TEXTURES` and copy all the contents from the .zip into it.      
    *Note:*
- Turn any texture upscaling options **OFF**.
- Do **NOT** enable texture saving.
- As much as possible, use Vulkan as the backend to decrease potential stuttering.
# To-do list
- Generic effects *(i.e. Auras, Rage)*
- Character-specific effects
- Mob sprites replacement
    *(Due to how tricky this is, this will be low-priority for now)*
- Support for other regions
