![](https://i.imgur.com/DIH6Eu4.png)

This texture pack is a one-man project that began on 2016, now ready for release.

# What's New?
### `v0.1`
- All stages now feature higher-quality textures. 
- Mob sprites are collected into respective folders.

# Installation
## Option 1
Create a folder named `ULUS10466` in `memstick\PSP\TEXTURES` and copy all the contents from the .zip into it.
## Option 2
As of `v1.8.0-429-ga49a0fc07`, it's now possible to drag n' drop the .zip into PPSSPP. Simply open the game, pause it, then drag the .zip file into the PPSSPP window.

**Note:**
- Turn any texture scaling options **OFF**.
- Do **NOT** enable texture saving.
- As much as possible, use Vulkan as the backend to decrease potential stuttering.
