# Installation
In your PPSSPP directory, navigate to `memstick/PSP/TEXTURES` then drag n' drop the contents of the .zip into the folder.

**Note:**  
- Turn any texture scaling options **OFF**.
- Do **NOT** enable texture saving.
- As much as possible, use Vulkan as the backend to decrease potential stuttering.
